CS3205 : Assignment 4
GBN and SR protocols
Shreesha G Bhat (CS18B103)

Instructions To Run the Programs

1) Run "make GBN" and "make SR" respectively to generate the executables for Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat. "make clean" removes the executables. 
2) The sender and receiver for both protocols are setup only for local communication and not for communication between machines. 
3) Use "127.0.0.1" (the loopback IP) and "12345" as the port numbers. 
4) The specific command line arguments for each protocol can be printed by running "./SenderGBN" or "./ReceiverGBN" or "./SenderSR" or "./ReceiverSR" respectively. 

Usage for ./SenderGBN : 
Usage :
./SenderGBN 足-d -s <receiver_IP> -p <receiver_port_num> -l <packet_length> -r <packet_gen_rate> -n <max_packets> -w <window_size> -b <max_buffer_size>

Usage for ./ReceiverGBN : 
Usage :
./ReceiverGBN 足-d -p <receiver_port_num> -n <max_packets> -w <sender_window_size> -e <packet_error_rate>

Usage for ./SenderSR :
Usage : ./SenderSR 足-d -s <receiver_IP> -p <receiver_port_num> -n <sequence_number_bits> -L <max_packet_length> -R <packet_gen_rate> -N <max_packets> -W <window_size> -B <max_buffer_size>


Usage for ./ReceiverSR: 
Usage : ./ReceiverSR 足-d -p <receiver_port_num> -N <max_packets> -n <sequence_number_bits> -W <sender_window_size> -B <max_buffer_size> -e <packet_error_rate>
