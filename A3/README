Instructions to run the code
1) To run the simulation on a custom input file
   Steps : 
   1) Create the input file according to the given format in the problem statement, name it as "input" and save it in the current directory.
   2) Invoke "make custom" command on the shell. 
   3) Creates a directory called "Output" which contains the output file for each node i named as output-i.txt. 
2) To run the example simulations on the two given input files example-input1 and example-input2. 
   Steps :
   1) Make sure both the input files are in the current directory. 
   2) Invoke "make examples" command on the shell. 
   3) Creates a directory called ExamplesOutput which contains the output file for each node for each input file as output1-i.txt and output2-i.txt respectively. 
3) Use "make clean" to clear any existing Output/ExamplesOutput directory as well as the ospf executable.
